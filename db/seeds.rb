The banh mi sandwiches are made with a shiny, crusty baguette that has a good crunch without being chewy. The vegetables are fresh--almost ostentatiously so, as vibrant buckets of jalapeños and peeled carrots and baskets of fluffy cilantro are conspicuous in their open kitchen. I've so far tried the duck (good flavor, not enough meat, but happy to have the option available), the garlic chicken, and the classic barbecued pork sandwiches. Unlike other banh mi, which can run heavy on the jalapeños to make up for otherwise bland ingredients, the peppers in Dragon Eats's banh mi sandwiches add just the right note of piquancy to their well-balanced sauces and crunchy pickles. <br> <br> And about that line; the cooks power through the order very quickly, and the cucumber water while you wait is nice touch. The space itself is sunny, with tasteful dark wood countertops and touches of greenery. It's also, like many a SOMA haunt, a great place for shoe-watching.", signature: "-Ruby", tag1: "Lunch", tag2: "Sandwiches", tag3: "Vietnamese")

Certainly, one expects more from a Thai restaurant in San Francisco, California than gummy pad thai and bland curry. <br> <br> Expectations are terrible things. I was able to sample the country chicken (which my acquaintance described as 'crunchy chicken' and which seems a direct homage to Panda Express in both concept and execution), yellow curry with duck (a good portion of duck; a sadly indifferent portion of everything else), what may have been the most boring pad thai dish I have ever tasted outside of a university cafeteria, the tom ka gai soup (pleasant, if not spicy enough), and calamari appetizer. This last had a pleasing light batter and bright crunch without being over-fried. They should promote the fry-er of that calamari to oversee the rest of the kitchen. Portions were large, but it is perhaps most damning that no one in our party of impoverished students wanted to save the leftovers. The lounge space is comfortably lit with rich colors and nice cushions. It looks like an excellent place to get cocktails. And indeed, the cocktails were excellent $6 drinks. They were priced between $13-15.", signature: "-Ruby", tag1: "Dinner", tag2: "Cocktails", tag3: "Ostensibly Thai")
